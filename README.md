cat428-glitch-text-adventure
============================

A very very very very very 1st version of Glitch "running" as an inform7 text adventure for putting onto Playfic.

Currently it just contains 2 "rooms" with stuff in, mainly so I can get a handle on the very basic inform7 language.

Hopefully more "rooms" and better item interactions later as I add them.

This is a _slow project_, updates will happen slowly over time.

You can "play" the latest version of the game over at playfic: http://playfic.com/games/revdancatt/text-glitch
