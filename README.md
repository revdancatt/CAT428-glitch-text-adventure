cat428-glitch-text-adventure
============================

A very very very very very 1st version of Glitch "running" as an inform7 text adventure for putting onto Playfic.

Currently it just some "rooms" with very little in in, mainly so I can get a handle on the very basic inform7 language.

Hopefully more "rooms" and better item interactions later as I add them.

This is a _*slow project*_, updates will happen slowly over time.

You can "play" the latest version of the game over at playfic: http://playfic.com/games/revdancatt/text-glitch

*NOTE:* The one file you need to copy over to playfic.com is `text-glitch.inform/Source/story.ni` the rest is just inform7 IDE cruft.


TODO
====

1. Add the code in for the rest of the street vendors.
2. Add the code in for the rest of the street items.
3. Make the trees give fruit.
4. Make the rocks give rocks (if the player has a pick).
5. Add "money" to the system.
6. Allow the player to sell fruit to the vendor.
7. Allow the user to buy a pick from the vendor.


0.2.4
=====

Added minimal descriptions to all the streets in Alakol so in theory you can now find your way around the place by just reading the room description.
Also aliased Street to Room just because it feels nicer.

0.2.3
=====

Linked up all the rooms in Alakol


0.2.2
=====

Name all the streets on Alakol, link some of them up.
