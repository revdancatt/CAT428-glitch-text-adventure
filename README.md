cat428-glitch-text-adventure
============================

A very very very very very 1st version of Glitch "running" as an inform7 text adventure for putting onto Playfic.

Currently it just some "rooms" with very little in in, mainly so I can get a handle on the very basic inform7 language.

Hopefully more "rooms" and better item interactions later as I add them.

This is a _*slow project*_, updates will happen slowly over time.

You can "play" the latest version of the game over at playfic: http://playfic.com/games/revdancatt/text-glitch

*NOTE:* The one file you need to copy over to playfic.com is `text-glitch.inform/Source/story.ni` the rest is just inform7 IDE cruft.
